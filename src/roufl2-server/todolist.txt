=> Authentication
	The client types username, password
	request sent on server : AUTH cnonce(generated randomly) username(given by client) response(computed with formula)
	response given by server : BADAUTH or OK

	Details
		when client presses enter ==> a first calculation is made on client side
			using the cnonce, the username, and the password
			it generates a first response that is then given to the server : giving AUTH cnonce(the same) username and response
		then the server receives the request, recognizes the username
			and recomputes the hash(sha1) with the cnonce, the username and the password stocked on the server
			if the reponse given is the same as the response computed ==> OK
			else ==> BADAUTH
		the :  in the formula is used to split the values
		In this case it is used in the formula

=> Client side
	Client types SERIALIZE or UNSERIALIZE
		then the programming language
		then the data to (un)serialize
		then the output format (JSON, XML, Binary)
		then the response from the auth + the username 

=> server side
	when a client logs, we send him a cnonce
